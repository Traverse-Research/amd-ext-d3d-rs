# Regenerating bindings

## Source

Bindings in [`AmdDxExt`](.metadata/AmdDxExt/) are taken from [`RadeonDeveloperToolSuite-2023-02-15-1051\samples\AmdDxExt`](https://gpuopen.com/introducing-radeon-developer-tool-suite/).
TODO: Take them from https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/common_src_amddxext instead _if that is the correct upstream_.
